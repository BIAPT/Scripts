# IEEE Challenge
- The first experiment was to explore the data and see what could be done with it
- The second experiment was to see how to apply the pre_process task to all participants
- The third experiment is to try out classification on the features and label (it's a jupyter notebook)

## How to use
- You need to have MATLAB for the first two experiment
- for the third one you need to have jupyter + the whole scipy stuff
