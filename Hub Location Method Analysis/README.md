# Hub Location Method Analysis
This project purposes is to explore and validate multiple ways to calculate the hub location using wPLI. This was motivated by the AUDACE project 'Clowning Around with the Sound of Consciousness' and 'EEGsonic' development.

## Dependencies
- MATLAB 2018a and above
- NeuroAlgo 0.0.1

## How to setup the experiments
- Open MATLAB 2018a and above
- Navigate to Scripts/"Hub Location Method Analysis"
- run `setup_project.m` on the command prompt; this will get the right dependencies from our github (NeuroAlgo 0.0.1)
- Open `setup_experiments.m` and edit the settings to match your experimental settings

## Experiment Codename
- **experiment_0_** means that the experiment was there as a draft to test stuff out quickly, it can be ran but it is not the final version that should be used. It most likely uses settings that are not overidden by the main setup_experiments script.
- **experiment_1_** means that the experiment is using the raw data to generate processed data that can be used for further analysis
- **experiment_2_** means that the experiment are used to generate figures/chart/plot summary that are used for answer a research question

experiment_0 are all living in the **experimental** folder

## Experiments
Here are some high level details about each of the experiments for this analysis

### ex_0_0_calculate_wpli_small_steps
In this simple experiment we calculate the wPLI with a short time step and we save it to the output path. This experiment is a generator for `ex_0_1_visualize_wpli_small_steps.m` which will create visualization to double check the wPLI matrices that are being created.

### ex_0_1_visualize_wpli_small_steps
In this experiment, we take the data generated by `ex_0_0_calculate_wpli_small_steps` to create the following figures:
- plot the average wpli matrix (one per brain)
- plot of the average global wpli values over time (one per channel per brain)
- plot the standard deviation of the global wpli values over timer (one per channel per brain)
- generate a video of the topographic map made by the matrices over time (one video per brain)

TODO: Save the figures in the output folder under a /figure directory
