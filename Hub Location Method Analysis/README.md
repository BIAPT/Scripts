# Hub Location Method Analysis
This project purposes is to explore and validate multiple ways to calculate the hub location using wPLI. This was motivated by the AUDACE project 'Clowning Around with the Sound of Consciousness' and 'EEGsonic' development.

## Dependencies
- MATLAB 2018a and above
- NeuroAlgo 0.0.1

## How to setup the experiments
- Open MATLAB 2018a and above
- Navigate to Scripts/"Hub Location Method Analysis"
- run `setup_project.m` on the command prompt; this will get the right dependencies from our github (NeuroAlgo 0.0.1)
- Open `setup_experiments.m` and edit the settings to match your experimental settings

## Experiment Codename
- **experiment_0** means that the experiment was there as a draft to test stuff out quickly, it can be ran but it is not the final version that should be used
- **experiment_1** means that the experiment is using the raw data to generate processed data that can be used for further analysis
- **experiment_2** means that the experiment are used to generate figures/chart/plot summary that are used for answer a research question

experiment_0 are all living in the **experimental** folder
