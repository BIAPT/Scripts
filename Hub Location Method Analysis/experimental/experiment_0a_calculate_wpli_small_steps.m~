    This is the first try of calculating the Hub location using degree on
    wPLI in healthy individual. This require NeuroAlgo v0.0.1. The first
    step is to calculate wpli with a 0.1 steps to see if we get something
    that make sense.

% Calculate the wPLI which is the basis for the hub location network

frequency_band = [8 14]; % This is in Hz
window_size = 10; % This is in seconds and will be how we chunk the whole dataset
number_surrogate = 20; % Number of surrogate wPLI to create
p_value = 0.05; % the p value to make our test on
