%   This is based on experiment_1 and will calculate the following feature

% -> clust_coeff 82x1
% -> norm_avg_clust_coeff 1x1
% -> norm_g_eff 1x1
% -> community 1x1
% -> small_worldness 1x1
% X is a 86x1 feature vector and the first 82 map to the source localized
% regions
%
% graph here is a functional connectivity matrix

    % Threshold the matrix
    t_grap = threshold_matrix(graph,t_level);
    % Binarize the matrix
    b_graph = binarize_matrix(t_grap);
    % Generate the null networks
    null_networks = generate_null_networks(b_graph, num_null_network, bin_swaps, weight_frequency);
