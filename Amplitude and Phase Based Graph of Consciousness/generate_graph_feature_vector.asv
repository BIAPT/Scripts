function [X] = generate_graph_feature_vector(graph, num_null_network, bin_swaps, weight_frequency, t_level)
%GENERATE_FEATURE_VECTOR calculate graph theory feature
%   This is based on experiment_1 and will calculate the following feature
%   vector:
% -> clust_coeff 82x1
% -> norm_avg_clust_coeff 1x1
% -> norm_g_eff 1x1
% -> community 1x1
% -> small_worldness 1x1
% X is a 86x1 feature vector and the first 82 map to the source localized
% regions
%
% graph
