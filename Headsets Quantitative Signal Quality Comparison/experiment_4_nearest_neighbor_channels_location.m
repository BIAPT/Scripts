% This script was written in the context of a comment we got for my paper
% on headsets comparison of signal quality using functional connectivity.
% The reviewer wanted to see a number associated to how similar to gold
% standard the other headset features were. In this script I will develop a
% nearest neighbor based approach to map one headset into another.

%% Load the two headset to compare
path_egi = "data/egi_open.mat";
path_dsi = "data/openbci/open_bci_open.mat";

egi_location = load_headset_location(path_egi);
dsi_location = load_headset_location(path_dsi);


%% Use one headset as a filter for the other headset location
filtered_egi_location = filter_location(egi_location,dsi_location);

%% Visualize the two headset channels that are left
figure;
plot_eeg_location(egi_location,'blue','o');
hold on;
plot_eeg_location(dsi_location,'red','o');
hold on;
plot_eeg_location(filtered_egi_location,'green','*');

%% Filter both the headset location and the data
% Load the full EEG data
egi_eeg = load_eeg(path_egi);
dsi_eeg = load_eeg(path_dsi);

% Filter using the same idea as filter_location
filtered_egi_eeg = filter_eeg(egi_eeg, dsi_eeg);

% Create the all uppercase data structure that is expected in EEGapp
EEG = filtered_egi_eeg;


%% Helper function
% Will load the headset location given a path
function [eeg_location] = load_headset_location(path)
    data = load(path);
    eeg_location = data.EEG.chanlocs;
end

% Will load the headset location given a path
function [eeg] = load_eeg(path)
    data = load(path);
    eeg = data.EEG;
end


% Will scan through each of the location filter to find its nearest
% neighbor in the eeg location to be filtered. It will output a filtered
% version of te eeg location.
function [filtered_eeg_location, closest_location] = filter_location(eeg_location, filter)
    
    % Create the location 3D matrix (X,Y,Z) for each electrodes
    location = zeros(length(eeg_location),3);
    for i = 1:length(eeg_location)
        radius = eeg_location(i).sph_radius;
        location(i,1) = eeg_location(i).X/radius;
        location(i,2) = eeg_location(i).Y/radius;
        location(i,3) = eeg_location(i).Z/radius;
    end

    % Find the optimal location
    closest_location = zeros(1,length(filter));
    for i = 1:length(filter)
        radius = filter(i).sph_radius;
        spatial_filter = [filter(i).X filter(i).Y filter(i).Z]/radius;
        closest_location(i) = knnsearch(location,spatial_filter,'K',1,'Distance','euclidean');
    end
    
    % Filter based on the index
    filtered_eeg_location = eeg_location(closest_location);
end

% Wrapper function to plot as a scatter plot the 3d data of the location
function plot_eeg_location(location, color,type)
    X = zeros(1,length(location));
    Y = zeros(1,length(location));
    Z = zeros(1,length(location));
    
    for i = 1:length(location)
        radius = location(i).sph_radius;
        X(i) = location(i).X/radius;
        Y(i) = location(i).Y/radius;
        Z(i) = location(i).Z/radius;
    end
    
    scatter3(X,Y,Z,type,'MarkerFaceColor',color)
    
end

% Will scan through each of the location filter to find its nearest
% neighbor in the eeg location to be filtered. It will output a filtered
% version of te eeg data with the location updated.

    % Filter the eeg with the filter eeg to find the id that match the two

    [~, filter_mask] = filter_location(eeg.chanlocs, filter.chanlocs);
    
    % Make the change in nbchan, data and chanlocs using filter_mask
    filtered_eeg = eeg;
    filtered_eeg.nbchan = length(filter.chanlocs);
    filtered_eeg.data = eeg.data(filter_mask,:);
