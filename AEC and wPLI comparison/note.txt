Different classifier:
To check that our result still hold with different classifier we will use LDA, Linear SVM and RBF SVM.


Thomas Thiery answer for the permutation:
1) I permute the label before I do any steps of the classification,
then I use the exact same pipeline and try to classify with random labels.

But your classes are not too unbalanced, you actually use AUC (Area Under the Curve) as a measure instead of decoding accuracy.
In theory, this measure is insensitive to unbalanced classes. However, it only works for binary classification.

-> This doesn't help that much. I'll need to do the permutation anyway.


STEP 1:
- Run the analysis with linear kernel again with good C values
- Run the analysis with rbf linear kernel with good C values + gamma
- Run the analysis with the LDA (might not need to do hyperparameters tuning)
