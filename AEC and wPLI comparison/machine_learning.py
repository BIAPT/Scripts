This script was created in the context of the comparison of source localized aec and wpli performance in classifying various conscious state in healthy subject.
This python script purpose is to run the classification, the preprocessing is currently done in the MATLAB script name 'preprocess.m'
This script make use of sklearn, scipy, numpy, matplotlib and pickle. The import are being carried on in their relative module.
